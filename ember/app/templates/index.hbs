    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>We're building a crowd-sourced recommendation platform for Creative Commons music.  We want to help music fans find open-licensed music that fits their musical preferences.</p>
    <p>We're bootstrapping our website with a few popular Creative Commons music databases and <a href="http://the.echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a> music recommendation system.</p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Why is this necessary?</h2>
    <p>With CC music you can share playlists, remix music, include music in your YouTube videos, and much more.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately discovering Creative Commons music is difficult.  Music databases and curated music podcasts cannot cater to their entire user base.  We think a recommendation system is the right solution.</p>
